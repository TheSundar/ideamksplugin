#summary Describes the CLI commands used by the plugin

= Viewsandbox commands =

== all members locally modified ==
si viewsandbox --filter=changed:working


== all out of sync members ==
 si viewsandbox --filter=changed:sync
 => candidates for incoming changes

== modified without checkout members ==
si viewsandbox --filter=changed:working --filter=!locked:$user$
 (locally changed, but not locked by user)

= How to ... =
== revert a deferred add operation ==
 si revert "filename"
this does not delete the file itself

== fetch new members of a sandbox ==
 si resync --filter=changed:newmem
will only syncrhonize new members

== resynchronize only non locally-modified files ==
si resync --filter=changed:sync --filter=!changed:working
== resynchronize only newly added files ==
si resync --filter=changed:newmem --filter=!changed:working


= Important : encoding issues =
It seems encodings need to be set differently depending on the commands.
On my Installation (French machine, French server), it seems most of si commands (especially si viewcps, and any command that outputs dates) need to be run with one of the following encodings : IBM00858 IBM437 IBM850 IBM857 IBM861 IBM863 IBM865, but the encoding used to checkin files is different : ISO-8859-1 needs to be used for si viewrevision
