#guide for building the plugin from subversion
= Introduction =

The plugin uses a maven2 build, and needs installing IDEA and mks libraries in the local repository to build.


= Details =

first checkout the branch you want (/trunk for example), then you need to install in your local repository the following artifacts

|| maven id || where to find it ||
|| com.mks:mkscmapi:8.3.2392 || in the /lib of the checked out branch ||
|| com.intellij.idea:openapi:${idea.version} || in IDEA's install folder || 
|| com.intellij.idea:annotations:${idea.version}  || in IDEA's install folder ||
|| com.intellij.idea:extensions:${idea.version}  || in IDEA's install folder ||

7361 is the official 7.0 release, but you should be able to use any 7.0 eaps

The file install-idea-files.bat  found at the root of the branch can act as an example (for windows obviously)
